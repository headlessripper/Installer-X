one stop installation wizard to all my releases 

Key Features of an Installation Wizard:
Welcome Screen: This introductory screen presents the user with information about the software, its purpose, and a brief overview of the installation process.

Prerequisite Checks: Before proceeding with the installation, the wizard may check if the system meets certain requirements (e.g., available disk space, system compatibility, or required software versions).

License Agreement: The wizard often includes a step where the user is asked to read and agree to the terms and conditions of the software license before proceeding.

Installation Path Selection: Users are prompted to choose or confirm the destination folder where the software will be installed. This step may also allow users to browse for a specific directory.

File Selection: If the installation includes multiple components, the wizard may allow users to select specific features or files to install.

Progress and Feedback: The installation wizard provides real-time progress feedback, such as a progress bar and status messages, to inform the user of the ongoing process.

Download and Extraction: If the software needs to be downloaded, the wizard manages the download, shows progress, and can automatically extract files (e.g., ZIP archives) once the download is complete.

Completion and Cleanup: After the software is installed, the wizard may offer the user an option to launch the program, and it will also display a completion message to confirm that the installation was successful.

Customization Options: Some wizards allow users to configure preferences, such as desktop shortcuts, additional plugins, or language settings, before completing the installation.

Error Handling and Support: In case of errors, the wizard typically provides troubleshooting steps or error messages to help users resolve issues.

The goal of an installation wizard is to make the installation process straightforward and accessible, even for users with limited technical expertise, while ensuring that all necessary components are installed correctly and efficiently.
